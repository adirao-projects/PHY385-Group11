## Measuring the Wavelength of Light Sources

### HeNe laser

- Apparatus specifications should be available on the PHY385 lab page

**Setting up the interferometer**

- Setup was repeated from the previous lab

- Laser placed in the corner, mirrors placed to have it "snake around" the edges

- This time, the beam splitter was changed so that the output beam was directed away from the laser
	- Gives us more space to shift the photo-diode
	- Helps to prevent us from accidentally blocking off the initial beam while adjusting the interferometer

- To help align the mirrors, we used a ruler, and leveraged the shape of the breadboard
	- Mounts were aligned straight with the screws in the breadboard, which we know to be very precisely manufactured
	- We used the ruler guarantee the grips on the mounts were oriented the same

- To align the mirrors, we swapped from the near to the far field, watching the projection on a piece of paper
	- Adjusted one mirror in the far field, and the other in the near field

- Once we had satisfactory alignment, we swapped out the paper, and replaced it with a photo-diode

- This setup was recreated on the second day. The only change being the inclusion of two diaphragm iris'. Placed at the input and output of the interferometer
	- They help to block back reflections, and reduce noise

**Creating the fringe pattern**
- The photo-diode was swapped out for a camera, because we felt it would be easier to collect data this way
- We used a lens to increase the side of the fringe pattern
- Using a paper as an observation screen, we continued to align the mirrors to improve the fringe contrast
- A polarizer was placed after the lens, to give us more control over the brightness of the fringes
- Paper replaced with the camera. Video sent to a desktop monitor

**Collecting data**
- Measurements were taken by adjusting the location of one of the mirrors, and saving an image
- Location of the mirror was saved in the image file name
- The increased path length difference would change the time delay on the interfering lasers during the re-combination

- We struggled to collect data from the camera, so we swapped to the photo-diode
- Our goal is to slowly adjust the path length difference, and then count the number of intensity oscillations which appear on an oscilloscope. These oscillations should be on the scale of the wavelength
- Data was collected from the oscilloscope, and graphed afterwards. The number of peaks/troughs should correspond to the wavelength of light

### LED

**Apparatus specifications**
LED Light:
- Standard blue LED
- 2.8 V, manual claims 3.2 V, but this trips the OCP
- 20 mA
- Manual also claims 2.2 for the red LED and 3.2 for the gree LED
- Power supply needs to run in controlled current mode, because there is no resistor in series with the LEDs

2 diaphragm iris'. Standard, taken from the lab kit.

Transmission grating
- GT13-03
- Visible transmission grating
- 300 grooves/mm

N-BK7 Piano Convex lens
- LA1951
- Focal length 25.3 mm
- Round lens

N-BK7 Piano Convex lens
- LA1509
- Focal length 99.7 mm
- Flatter lens

**Setting up the spectrometer**
- LED was placed using a platform and platform clamp. The LED was placed such that its wires were pressed into the platform by the clamp, keeping it in place

- Diaphragm iris placed right after the LED to filter out particularly chaotic light
	- Distance between the LED and iris: 1.5 cm

- Round lens placed after the iris
	- This lens has a very short focal length, and so is better for focusing the LED light to a point quickly
	- We had to experiment with numerous lengths to focus the LED light to a small point
	- Distance between the iris and lens: 6.5 cm

- Light was most focused at the focal point of the lens, it was at this position we placed another iris
	- This iris was once again placed here to limit chaotic light. It filters out light that wasn't sufficiently filtered through the lens
	- Distance between the lens and iris: 3.6 cm

- The flatter lens was placed after the iris
	- The distance between the iris and the flatter lens must match the focal length of the flatter lens
	- This is a requirement to collimate the light after passing through the lens
	- Distance between the iris and len: 10.6 cm

- Transmission grating placed after the flat lens. It was placed quite close to increase the intensity of the diffraction fringes
	- Distance between the lens and grating: 6.6 cm

**Data Collection**
- Fringes blocked with a paper, where the light is projected
	- Acts as our projection screen
- The positions of the fringes were marked on the paper
- Distance between the paper and the diffraction grating: 24.13 cm, 24.4 cm
- Alignment of the 0th order fringe is very straight. So much so that it is reasonable to assume the central diffraction fringe is located at 0 degrees
